<h3 >My name is Qinwen, my friends are more willing to call me Owen.  I came from Brooklyn, New York and have been in the US four and half years. I am majoring in Computer Science in SUNY Buffalo. Why CS? Do you notice, computer technology is changing your life all the time. I don't want to be passive and computer programming is my favorite interet. Since I learned computing language in high school, I completely fell in love with it.   </h>

<h1> My Courses:</h1>
<br>
<h2>CSE 115LR Intro to CS Majors 1</h2>
<h3>Computer Science & Engineering</h3>
<p>Provides the fundamentals of the field to computer science and computer engineering majors, introducing students to algorithm design and implementation in a modern, high-level programming language. Emphasizes problem solving by abstraction. Topics include object-oriented design using a formal modeling language; fundamental object-oriented principles such as classes, objects, interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism; simple event-driven programming; data types; variables; expressions; basic imperative programming techniques, including assignment, input/output, subprograms, parameters, sequencing, selection and iteration; the use of aggregate data structures, such as arrays or more general collections; simple design patterns. No previous programming experience required.<a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/alphonce/">See more information? Click ME!</a></p>
<br>
<h2>CSE 199SR UB Seminar</h2>
<h3>Computer Science & Engineering</h3>
<p>The three credit UB Seminar is focused on a big idea or challenging issue to engage students with questions of significance in a field of study and, ultimately, to connect their studies with issues of consequence in the wider world. Essential to the UB Curriculum, the Seminar helps students with common learning outcomes focused on fundamental expectations for critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and oral communication, and learning at a university, all within topic focused subject matter. The Seminars provide students with an early connection to UB faculty and the undergraduate experience at a comprehensive, research university. This course is equivalent to any 199 offered in any subject. This course is a controlled enrollment (impacted) course. Students who have previously attempted the course and received a grade of F or R may not be able to repeat the course during the fall or spring semester.</p>
<br>
<h2>ENG 105LEC Writing and Rhetoric</h2>
<h3>English</h3>
<p>An introduction to research, writing, and rhetorical practices employed in academic and professional contexts. The course examines the operation of genres, the audiences they address, and the purposes they serve. The course focuses on the analysis and development of student writing and rhetorical practice. Assignments include research essays, digital compositions, and oral presentations.</p>
<br>
<h2>MTH 141LR College Calculus 1</h2>
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>Beginning of a three-semester sequence in calculus for students of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering. Covers differentiation and integration with applications. This course is a controlled enrollment (impacted) course. Students who have previously attempted the course and received a grade other than W may repeat the course in the summer or winter; or only in the fall or spring semester with a petition to the College of Arts and Sciences Deans’ Office.</p>
